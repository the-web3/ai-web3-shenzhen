# Reown AppKit Integration Guide

This guide explains how to use the Reown AppKit integration for email/social login and fiat on-ramp features.

## What is Reown?

Reown (formerly WalletConnect) AppKit is an all-in-one SDK that enables:

- **Email Login**: Users can create crypto wallets using just their email address (no browser extensions needed)
- **Social Login**: Login with Google, Twitter, GitHub, Discord, Apple, or Facebook
- **Multi-Wallet Support**: Connect with MetaMask, Rainbow, Coinbase Wallet, Trust Wallet, and 300+ others
- **Fiat On-Ramp**: Buy cryptocurrency with credit cards or bank transfers
- **Mobile Support**: Works seamlessly on iOS and Android devices

## User Experience

### For Users Without Crypto Wallets

1. **Click "Email / Social Login"** button on homepage
2. **Enter email address** or choose a social login provider
3. **Verify via email** (receive verification code)
4. **Wallet created automatically** - users get an Ethereum address without installing anything
5. **Buy crypto** - users can purchase USDT/USDC with credit card directly in the app

### For Users With Existing Wallets

1. **Click "Wallet"** button to connect existing wallet
2. **Choose wallet** (MetaMask, Rainbow, Coinbase, etc.)
3. **Approve connection** in wallet extension/app
4. **Start using** - full access to Protocol Banks features

## Configuration

### Environment Variable

Add this to your `.env` or Vars section:

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_REOWN_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id_here
```

Get your Project ID from: https://cloud.reown.com

### Important: Remote Dashboard Configuration

**Note**: You may see this notice in the browser console:

```env
[Reown Config Notice] Your local configuration for "features.email", "features.socials", "features.onramp" was ignored because a remote configuration was successfully fetched.
```

**This is expected behavior.** Reown AppKit manages features (email login, social logins, fiat on-ramp) through the remote dashboard at https://dashboard.reown.com, not through local code configuration. This provides centralized control over features across all deployments.

To enable features:

1. Visit https://dashboard.reown.com
2. Select your project
3. Navigate to "Features" section
4. Enable/disable:
   - Email authentication
   - Social login providers (Google, Twitter, GitHub, Discord, Apple, Facebook)
   - Fiat on-ramp providers (Coinbase Pay, MoonPay, Transak, Ramp Network)
5. Save changes

The AppKit will automatically fetch and apply your dashboard settings. No code changes are needed.

### Supported Networks

Currently configured for:
- Ethereum Mainnet (Chain ID: 1)
- Sepolia Testnet (Chain ID: 11155111)
- Base (Chain ID: 8453)

import { useAppKitProvider } from '@reown/appkit/react'

function MyComponent() {
